Scanner Generator Rex
=====================

Rex makes use of a library of reusable Modula-2 modules (MLIB=reuse).
This library must be compiled before Rex itself.

To generate Rex the first time use:

   make <configuration>_boot MLIB=...
   make install BIN=... LIB=...

When Rex and Lark are operational the following should suffice:

   make <configuration> MLIB=...
   make install BIN=... LIB=...
